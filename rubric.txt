# AI-Readiness Scorecard for S&P 500 Annual Report Analysis

Analyze the company's AI readiness based on the scorecard defined below, using the provided 10-K report excerpts and supplementary company information. Provide a score (1-5) for each dimension and an overall weighted average score.

**Important Context:** You are analyzing **targeted excerpts** from 10-K filings (not complete filings) that contain AI-related keywords, along with general company information from public sources. Your scoring should be **primarily based on evidence from the 10-K excerpts**, but you may consider the supplementary information for additional context about the company's scale, industry positioning, and business model complexity.

## Scoring Instructions

- **Be specific and provide EVIDENCE**: For **every** score you assign to each dimension, you **must** explicitly cite the exact phrases, sentences, or specific sections from the provided 10-K report excerpts that directly support your rating. If no direct evidence is found, state that clearly.
- **Look for concrete initiatives and investments**: Prioritize ratings based on mentions of specific AI projects, financial commitments to AI, established data science teams, concrete examples of AI applications, and measurable outcomes. Avoid being swayed by general or aspirational statements.
- **Consider the comprehensiveness and strategic importance**: Evaluate the scale and ambition of the company's AI-related activities. A score of 5 should represent a truly leading position where AI is deeply integrated and a core competitive advantage.
- **Note contextual influences**: If the supplementary company information (industry sector, company size, business model) influenced your assessment beyond what's evident in the 10-K excerpts, briefly mention this in your analysis.
- **Utilize the full 1-5 scale with clear differentiation**: Do not cluster scores in the middle. A rating of 3 indicates a developing stage. Ratings of 1 and 2 should be reserved for minimal or emerging efforts, while 4 and 5 signify advanced and leading positions, respectively. Justify why a company deserves a particular score, especially at the extremes (1 or 5).
