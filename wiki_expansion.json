The company has also expanded into new markets, such as thedata center,gaming, andhigh-performance computing[2]markets. AMD's processors are used in a wide range of computing devices, includingpersonal computers, servers,laptops, andgaming consoles. While it initially manufactured its own processors, the company lateroutsourced its manufacturing, afterGlobalFoundrieswas spun off in 2009. Through itsXilinxacquisition in 2022, AMD offersfield-programmable gate array(FPGA) products.\nAMD was founded in 1969 byJerry Sandersand a group of other technology professionals. The company's early products were primarily memory chips and other components for computers. In 1975, AMD entered the microprocessor market, competing withIntel, its main rival in the industry. In the early 2000s, it experienced significant growth and success, thanks in part to its strong position in the PC market and the success of itsAthlonandOpteronprocessors. However, the company faced challenges in the late 2000s and early 2010s, as it struggled to keep up with Intel in the race to produce faster and more powerful processors.\nIn the late 2010s, AMD regainedmarket shareby pursuing apenetration pricingstrategy[3]and building on the success of itsRyzenprocessors, which were considerably more competitive withIntel microprocessorsin terms of performance whilst offering attractive pricing.[4]In 2022, AMD surpassed Intel by market capitalization for the first time.[5][6]"

Clients will often use this in combination withautoscaling(a process that allows a client to use more computing in times of high application usage, and then scale down to reduce costs when there is less traffic). These cloud computingweb servicesprovide various services related to networking, compute, storage,middleware,IoTand other processing capacity, as well assoftware toolsvia AWSserver farms.  This frees clients from managing, scaling, and patching hardware and operating systems. \nOne of the foundational services isAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2), which allows users to have at their disposal avirtualcluster of computers, with extremely high availability, which can be interacted with over the internet viaRESTAPIs, aCLIor the AWS console.  AWS's virtual computers emulate most of the attributes of a real computer, including hardwarecentral processing units(CPUs) andgraphics processing units(GPUs) for processing; local/RAMmemory;hard-disk(HDD)/SSD storage; a choice ofoperating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such asweb servers,databases, andcustomer relationship management(CRM).\nAWS services are delivered to customers via a network of AWS server farms located throughout the world. Fees are based on a combination of usage (known as a \"Pay-as-you-go\" model), hardware, operating system, software, and networking features chosen by the subscriber requiring various degrees ofavailability,redundancy,security, and service options. Subscribers can pay for a single virtual AWS computer, a dedicated physical computer, or clusters of either.[7]Amazon provides select portions of security for subscribers (e.g. physical security of the data centers) while other aspects of security are the responsibility of the subscriber (e.g. account management, vulnerability scanning, patching). AWS operates from many global geographical regions, including seven in North America.[8]\nAmazon markets AWS to subscribers as a way of obtaining large-scale computing capacity more quickly and cheaply than building an actual physical server farm.[9]All services are billed based on usage, but each service measures usage in varying ways. As of 2023 Q1, AWS has 31% market share for cloud infrastructure while the next two competitorsMicrosoft AzureandGoogle Cloudhave 25%, and 11% respectively, according to Synergy Research Group.[10][11]"

By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to formNeXT, and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures;John Sculleyserved as long-time CEO for over a decade. In the 1990s, Apple lost considerablemarket sharein thepersonal computerindustry to the lower-pricedWintelduopoly of theMicrosoft Windowsoperating systemonIntel-poweredPC clones.

Through theGreat Depression, they mainly produced components for other manufacturers, growing duringWorld War IIand diversifying into non-aircraft products after the war. During this period, they won a number of contracts to produce jet engine components. Convinced that thegas turbinewas the prime mover of the future, the company invested heavily in the development of small turbines.\nThe turbine never came to be the main prime mover, but Solar's expertise in small turbines found a number of niche roles. The company was purchased byInternational Harvester Companyin early 1960, becoming theSolar Division of International Harvesterin 1963. In 1973, the Solar Division exited the aerospace industry to focus solely on industrial turbines. In 1975, the development and manufacture of the Solar Division's radial engines was moved into a newly formed Radial Engines Group, renamed the Turbomach Division in 1980.[5]\nSolar Turbines Incorporatedbecame a wholly owned subsidiary ofCaterpillar Tractor Co.after Caterpillar purchased the assets of the Solar Division and the Turbomach division from International Harvester on 31 May 1981.

The prices quoted fortransactionson the exchange are the basis for prices that people pay for various commodities throughout the world.\nThe floor of the NYMEX is regulated by theCommodity Futures Trading Commission, anindependent agency of the United States government.  Each individual company that trades on the exchange must send its own independent brokers.  Therefore, a few employees on the floor of the exchange represent a bigcorporationand the exchange employees only record the transactions and have nothing to do with the actual trade.\nAlthough mostly electronic since 2006, the NYMEX maintained a small venue, or \"pit\", that still practiced theopen outcrytrading system, in which traders employed shouting and complex hand gestures on the physical trading floor. A project to preserve the hand signals used at NYMEX has been published.[2]NYMEX closed the pit permanently at the end of trading Friday, December 30, 2016, because of shrinking volume.[3]"

Pemberton had been severely wounded in theAmerican Civil War, and had become addicted to the pain medicationmorphine. At the time, cocaine was being promoted as a \"cure\" for opioid addiction, so he developed the beverage as apatent medicinein an effort to control his addiction.[3]\nIn 1889, the formula and brand were sold for $2,300 (roughly $71,000 in 2022) toAsa Griggs Candler, who incorporated the Coca-Cola Company inAtlanta, Georgia, in 1892.

In 2023, the company was ranked 51st in theForbesGlobal 2000.[10]\nComcast is additionally the nation's third-largest hometelephone service provider. It provides services to U.S. residential and commercial customers in 40 states and theDistrict of Columbia.[11]As the owner ofNBCUniversalsince2013, Comcast is also a high-volume producer offilmsfor theatrical exhibition and television programming, and atheme parksoperator. It is thefourth-largest telecommunications companyby worldwide revenue.[9]Comcast owns and operates theXfinityresidential cable communications business segment and division;Comcast Business, a commercial services provider; and Xfinity Mobile, anMVNOof Verizon Communications.\nComcast is also the owner and operator of over-the-air national broadcast network channels through NBCUniversal, such as theNational Broadcasting Company(one of the US'Big Three television networks), Spanish-language channelsTelemundo,TeleXitos, andUniverso,television stationslikeCozi TV, multiple cable-only channels such asMSNBC,CNBC,USA Network,Syfy,Oxygen True Crime,Bravo, andE!, film studiosUniversal Pictures,DreamWorks Animation,IlluminationandFocus Features, theUniversal Studio Group, the VOD streaming servicePeacock, andUniversal Destinations & Experiences.

NBCUniversal also works innews(NBC NewsandNoticias Telemundo) andsports(NBC SportsandTelemundo Deportes) areas, with Comcast acquiring professional sports companySpectacorin 1996. Since October 2018, Comcast is also the parent company ofSky Groupafter dropping out of the bid to buy21st Century Fox, and instead acquired the stake 21CF owned, plus the rest of Sky.\nComcast iscriticizedand put under intense public scrutiny for a variety of reasons. Its customer satisfaction ratings were among the lowest in the cable industry during the years 2008\u20132010.[12][13]It has violatednet neutralitypractices in the past and despite its commitment to a narrow definition of net neutrality,[14]critics advocate a definition that precludes any distinction between Comcast'sprivate networkservices and the rest of the Internet.[15]Critics also point out a lack of competition in the vast majority of Comcast's service areas; in particular, the limited competition among cable providers.[16]Given its negotiating power as a large ISP, some suspect that it could leverage paidpeering agreementsto unfairly influence end-user connection speeds. Its ownership of both content production (in NBCUniversal) and distribution (as an ISP) has raised antitrust concerns. These issues and others led to Comcast being dubbed \"The Worst Company in America\" byThe Consumeristin 2010 and 2014.[17][18]Comcast alsofailed to acquireTime Warner Cablein 2014."

It currently operates as a unique open retail and wholesale system primarily owned by three brewing companies:Molson,Labatt, andSleeman, which are owned by multinational corporations.[3]It is also partially owned (under 0.02%[4]) by 30 Ontario-based brewers.[5]Under the ownership model, all qualified brewers are free to list their products without discrimination and to set their own selling prices,[6]subject toLiquor Control Board of Ontario(LCBO) price approval that must comply with legislated minimum and uniform pricing requirements.[7]\nUnder Ontario'sLiquor Control Act, The Beer Store was formerly the only retailer permitted to sell beer for off-site consumption, other than stores on the site of a brewery, locations of the provincial government-owned LCBO, and LCBO-authorized agency stores in certain smaller communities.[8]The act and the company's articles of incorporation further stipulate that Brewers Retail cannot sell \"hard liquor\" (spirits) or consumer goods (like groceries). Brewers Retail adopted the current name in 1985.\nAmendments made to theLiquor Control Acthave since allowed for the sale of single and 6 packs of beer at selectsupermarketsin Ontario. That was done to enhance customer access and convenience. The Beer Store, however, continues to maintain pricing exclusivity in providing consumers discounts on larger packs of beer, along with retail partners, agency stores, combination stores and manufacturer outlets. What distinguishes the Beer Store is its characterization as a sort of \"beer commons.\"[9]A 2013Angus Reidsurvey commissioned by the Ontario Convenience Stores Association found that only 13% of Ontario residents were aware that \"The Beer Store monopoly is not a government-owned enterprise.\"[10][11]The Beer Store operated approximately 450 outlets in Ontario and made a gross profit of about $396-million in 2016.[12][13]\nIn early June 2019, the provincial government passed legislation to terminate its 10-year contract with the company, six years prior to expiry; continued negotiations with TBS were underway prior to actual enactment of the legislation. This step was a prelude to making beer widely available in variety stores in Ontario.[14][15]\nIn May 2024, the Ontario government announced an agreement with Brewers Retail allowing beer, wine, cider, and ready-to-mix alcoholic beverages to be sold, before the scheduled end of the master contract, in 8,000 corner stores, grocery stores, gas stations and eventually big box chains in exchange for $225 million in compensation being paid to The Beer Store. Sales in grocery and corner stores  began in September 2024. As a result, The Beer Store' s market share is expected to fall from 41% in 2024 to 15% by 2026-27.[16][17]Under the agreement, The Beer Store will continue to operate at least 300 stores until the end of 2025, after which there will be no restrictions on the number of outlets that may be shut down.[18]"

Dairy Milk chocolate, introduced byGeorge Jrin 1905, used a higher proportion of milk in the recipe than rival products. By 1914, it was the company's best-selling product. Successive members of theCadbury familyhave made innovations with chocolate products. Cadbury,Rowntree'sandFry'swere the big three British confectionery manufacturers throughout much of the 19th and 20th centuries.[5]\nCadbury was granted its firstroyal warrantfromQueen Victoriain 1854. It held a royal warrant fromElizabeth IIfrom 1955 to 2022.[6]Cadbury merged with J. S. Fry & Sons in 1919, andSchweppesin 1969, known as Cadbury Schweppes until 2008, when the American beverage business was split asDr Pepper Snapple Group; the rights ownership of the Schweppes brand had already differed between various countries since 2006. In 1992,Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the company for 24 years, produced theCadbury Report, a code of best practice which served as a basis for reform ofcorporate governancearound the world.[7]Cadbury was a constant constituent of theFTSE 100on theLondon Stock Exchangefrom the index's 1984 inception until the company was bought by Kraft Foods Inc. in 2010.[8][9]"

          "description": "World Wrestling Entertainment(WWE) is an Americanprofessional wrestling promotion. It is owned and operated byTKO Group Holdings, a majority-ownedsubsidiaryofEndeavor Group Holdings.[9]A global integrated media and entertainment company, WWE has also branched out into fields outside of wrestling, includingfilm,football, andother business ventures, such aslicensingitsintellectual propertyto other companies to producevideo gamesandaction figures.\nAs in other professional wrestling promotions, WWE does not promote a legitimate sporting contest but rather entertainment-based performancetheater, featuringstoryline-driven,scripted, and partially choreographed matches; however, matches often include moves that put performers at risk of serious injury or death if not performed correctly. The pre-determined aspect of professional wrestling (an industryopen secret) was publicly acknowledged by WWE in 1989 to avoid regulation by athletic commissions. WWE markets its product as \"sports entertainment\", acknowledging professional wrestling's roots in competitive sport anddramatic theater.\nThe promotion was founded in 1953 as theCapitol Wrestling Corporation(CWC), a Northeastern territory of theNational Wrestling Alliance(NWA). Due tobookingdisputes, CWC left the NWA and became theWorld Wide Wrestling Federation(WWWF) in April 1963. After rejoining the NWA in 1971, the WWWF was renamed theWorld Wrestling Federation(WWF) in 1979, and left the NWA again in 1983. Following atrademark dispute with the World Wildlife Fund, the WWF was renamedWorld Wrestling Entertainment(WWE) in 2002. In 2011, the promotion ceased branding itself as World Wrestling Entertainment and began solely using the initials WWE, although their legal name remained the same.[10]\nWWE is the largest wrestling promotion in the world. Its main roster is divided into twotouring brands,RawandSmackDown. Itsdevelopmental brands,NXTandEvolve, are based at theWWE Performance CenterinOrlando, Florida. The promotion's programming is available in more than one billion homes worldwide in 30 languages and its global headquarters is located inStamford, Connecticut,[11]with offices in New York, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Mumbai, Shanghai, Singapore, Dubai, and Munich.[12]\nWWE's corporate entity,Titan Sports, Inc., was incorporated on February 21, 1980, byVince McMahon: Titan acquired Capitol Wrestling Corporation Ltd., the holding company for the wrestling promotion, in 1982. Titan was renamedWorld Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc.in 1999, andWorld Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.in 2002. In January 2023, WWE began to explore a sale of the company, amidst an employee misconduct scandal involving McMahon that initially prompted him to step down as chairman and CEO.[13]In September, WWE merged withZuffa, the parent company ofmixed martial artspromotionUltimate Fighting Championship(UFC), to form TKO Group Holdings, a newpublic companymajority-owned by Endeavor Group Holdings, with McMahon as executive chairman:[14]the promotion's legal name was then changed toWorld Wrestling Entertainment, LLC.[15]In 2024, McMahon departed TKO amid asex trafficking scandaland was replaced as executive chairman byAri Emanuel.[16]"

In 2015, the Nilson Report, a publication that tracks the credit card industry, found that Visa's global network (known asVisaNet) processed 100\u00a0billion transactions during 2014 with a total volume of US$6.8\u00a0trillion.[7]\nVisa was founded in 1958 byBank of America(BofA) as theBankAmericardcredit card program.[1]In response to competitor Master Charge (nowMastercard), BofA began to license the BankAmericard program to other financial institutions in 1966.[8]By 1970, BofA gave up direct control of the BankAmericard program, forming acooperativewith the other various BankAmericard issuer banks to take over its management. It was then renamed Visa in 1976.[9]\nNearly all Visa transactions worldwide are processed through the company's directly operated VisaNet at one of four securedata centers, located inAshburn, VirginiaandHighlands Ranch, Coloradoin the United States;London, England; and inSingapore.[10]These facilities are heavily secured against natural disasters, crime, and terrorism; can operate independently of each other and from external utilities if necessary; and can handle up to 30,000 simultaneous transactions and up to 100 billion computations every second.[7][11][12]\nVisa is the world's second-largest card payment organization (debit and credit cards combined), after being surpassed byChina UnionPayin 2015, based on annual value of card payments transacted and number of issued cards.[13]However, because UnionPay's size is based primarily on the size of its domestic market inChina, Visa is still considered the dominant bankcard company in the rest of the world, where it commands a 50% market share of total card payments.[13]"

The brand began franchising in 1959, and its distinctive building style was designed by Chicago architect George Lindstrom in 1963. Pizza Hut experienced significant growth, including the acquisition by PepsiCo in 1977, followed by a spin-off into Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc., later renamedYum! Brands[5]in 2002, who are the current owners.\nPizza Hut introduced PizzaNet in 1994, an early internet ordering experiment, and continued innovation with offerings like stuffed crust pizza introduced in 1995. Pizza Hut has adapted its model to include various restaurant formats, including the family-style dine-in locations, carry-out, and hybrid locations. It has ventured into international markets, tailoring its menu to local tastes. The brand faced challenges, including the closure of numerous dine-in locations in the US and adjustments to its franchise operations. Despite these hurdles, Pizza Hut remains a significant player in the global fast-food industry, known for its innovative products and marketing strategies."
