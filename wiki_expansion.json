It is best known for itsconsumer electronics,software, andservices. Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company bySteve Jobs,Steve WozniakandRonald Wayne, the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year.

Its second computer, theApple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-producedmicrocomputers. Apple introduced theLisain 1983 and theMacintoshin 1984, as some of the first computers to use agraphical user interfaceand amouse. By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to formNeXT, and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures;John Sculleyserved as long-time CEO for over a decade. In the 1990s, Apple lost considerablemarket sharein thepersonal computerindustry to the lower-pricedWintelduopoly of theMicrosoft Windowsoperating systemonIntel-poweredPC clones. In 1997, Apple was weeks away frombankruptcy. To resolve its failed operating system strategy, it bought NeXT, effectively bringing Jobs back to the company, who guided Apple back to profitability over the next decade with the introductions of theiMac,iPod,iPhone, andiPaddevices to critical acclaim as well as theiTunes Store, launching the \"Think different\"advertisingcampaign, and opening theApple Storeretail chain. These moves elevated Apple to consistently be one of the world'smost valuable brandssince about 2010. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later; he was succeeded as CEO byTim Cook.\nApple's product lineupincludes portable and home hardware such as the iPhone, iPad,Apple Watch,Mac, andApple TV;operating systemssuch asiOS,iPadOS, andmacOS; andvarious softwareand services includingApple Pay,iCloud, and multimediastreamingservices likeApple MusicandApple TV+.

Its stock is listed on theNew York Stock Exchangeand is a component of theDJIAand theS&P 500andS&P 100indexes.\nCoca-Cola was developed in 1886 bypharmacistJohn Stith Pemberton. At the time it was introduced, the product contained thestimulantscocainefromcocaleaves andcaffeinefromkola nutswhich together actedsynergistically. The coca and the kola are the source of the product name, and led to Coca-Cola's promotion as a \"healthy tonic\". Pemberton had been severely wounded in theAmerican Civil War, and had become addicted to the pain medicationmorphine. At the time, cocaine was being promoted as a \"cure\" for opioid addiction, so he developed the beverage as apatent medicinein an effort to control his addiction.[3]\nIn 1889, the formula and brand were sold for $2,300 (roughly $71,000 in 2022) toAsa Griggs Candler, who incorporated the Coca-Cola Company inAtlanta, Georgia, in 1892. The company has operated afranchiseddistribution system since 1889.[4]The company largely produces syrup concentrate, which is then sold to variousbottlersthroughout the world who hold exclusive territories."

Its customer satisfaction ratings were among the lowest in the cable industry during the years 2008\u20132010.[12][13]It has violatednet neutralitypractices in the past and despite its commitment to a narrow definition of net neutrality,[14]critics advocate a definition that precludes any distinction between Comcast'sprivate networkservices and the rest of the Internet.[15]Critics also point out a lack of competition in the vast majority of Comcast's service areas; in particular, the limited competition among cable providers.[16]Given its negotiating power as a large ISP, some suspect that it could leverage paidpeering agreementsto unfairly influence end-user connection speeds. Its ownership of both content production (in NBCUniversal) and distribution (as an ISP) has raised antitrust concerns. These issues and others led to Comcast being dubbed \"The Worst Company in America\" byThe Consumeristin 2010 and 2014.[17][18]Comcast alsofailed to acquireTime Warner Cablein 2014."

Notable office locations includeSpokane, Washington;New York, New York;Boulder, Colorado;London, England;San Jose, California; andSan Francisco, California.[2]\nF5 originally offeredapplication delivery controller(ADC) technology,[3]but has since expanded intoapplication layer, automation, multi-cloud, and security services. Asransomware,data leaks,DDoS, and other attacks on businesses of all sizes are arising, companies such as F5 have continued to reinvent themselves.[4]While the majority of F5's revenue continues to be attributed to its hardware products, such as the BIG-IP iSeries systems, the company has begun to offer additional modules on its proprietary operating system, TMOS (Traffic Management Operating System).[5]These modules include Local Traffic Manager (LTM), Advanced Web Application Firewall (AWAF), DNS (previously named GTM), and Access Policy Manager (APM). These offer organizations that run BIG-IP systems the ability to deploy load balancing,Layer 7application firewalls,single sign-on(forAzure AD,Active Directory,LDAP, andOkta), as well as enterprise-levelVPNs. While the BIG-IP was traditionally a hardware product, F5 now offers it as avirtual machine, which it has branded as the BIG-IP Virtual Edition. The BIG-IP Virtual Edition is cloud-agnostic and can be deployedon-premisesin apublicand/orhybrid cloudenvironment.[citation needed]"

In 2015, the Nilson Report, a publication that tracks the credit card industry, found that Visa's global network (known asVisaNet) processed 100\u00a0billion transactions during 2014 with a total volume of US$6.8\u00a0trillion.[7]\nVisa was founded in 1958 byBank of America(BofA) as theBankAmericardcredit card program.[1]In response to competitor Master Charge (nowMastercard), BofA began to license the BankAmericard program to other financial institutions in 1966.[8]By 1970, BofA gave up direct control of the BankAmericard program, forming acooperativewith the other various BankAmericard issuer banks to take over its management. It was then renamed Visa in 1976.[9]\nNearly all Visa transactions worldwide are processed through the company's directly operated VisaNet at one of four securedata centers, located inAshburn, VirginiaandHighlands Ranch, Coloradoin the United States;London, England; and inSingapore.[10]These facilities are heavily secured against natural disasters, crime, and terrorism; can operate independently of each other and from external utilities if necessary; and can handle up to 30,000 simultaneous transactions and up to 100 billion computations every second.[7][11][12]\nVisa is the world's second-largest card payment organization (debit and credit cards combined), after being surpassed byChina UnionPayin 2015, based on annual value of card payments transacted and number of issued cards.[13]However, because UnionPay's size is based primarily on the size of its domestic market inChina, Visa is still considered the dominant bankcard company in the rest of the world, where it commands a 50% market share of total card payments.[13]"
