adversely affect or preclude the company\u2019s intellectual property rights in such products or services, or may expose the company to liability related to the infringement, misappropriation or other violation of third-party intellectual property.\nThe use of AI technologies with personally identifiable information may also result in legal liability.\nFurther, particularly given the nascent stage
