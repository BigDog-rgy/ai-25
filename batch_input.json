artificial intelligence, has the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way financial institutions, including asset managers, do business.\nSome of our competitors may be more successful than we are in the development and implementation of new technologies, including services and platforms based on artificial intelligence, to address investor demand or improve operations.\nThese cybersecurity threats and compromises could occur as a result of threat actors impersonating Blackstone or its employees, including through the use of artificial intelligence

risks and compliance costs.\nTechnological developments in artificial intelligence, including machine learning technology and generative artificial intelligence (collectively, \u201cAI Technologies\u201d) and their current and potential future applications, including in the private investment and financial sectors, as well as the legal and regulatory frameworks within which they operate, are rapidly evolving.\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission released a joint statement on artificial intelligence demonstrating interest in monitoring the development and use of automated systems and enforcement of their respective laws and regulations.\nIn addition to the U.S. regulatory framework, in 2024, the EU adopted the Artificial Intelligence Act in 2024, which applies to certain AI Technologies and the data used to train, test and deploy them, which may create additional compliance burdens, higher administrative costs and significant penalties should we fail to comply.\nWe additionally continue to believe that, despite recent speculation about data center demand, there will continue to be significant demand for digital infrastructure as artificial

BUSINESS Overview Founded in 2011, CrowdStrike reinvented cybersecurity for the cloud and artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) era and transformed the way cybersecurity is delivered and experienced by customers.\nSince November 2017, he has also served as Chairman of the Board, and as President for the CrowdStrike Foundation, a nonprofit established to support the next generation of talent and research in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence through scholarships, grants, and other activities.\nSince November 2017, he has also served as Treasurer and as a board member for the

through scholarships, grants, and other activities, and a member of the Forbes Technology Counsel, an organization for senior technology executives.\nKeyword: ai\nWe took a fundamentally different approach to solve this problem with the AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon cybersecurity platform \u2013 the first, true, cloud-native platform built with AI at the core, capable of harnessing vast amounts of security and enterprise data to deliver highly modular solutions through a single lightweight agent.\nWe use this to train our AI to detect and prevent threats and drive workflow automation to give security teams machine speed advantage to stop adversaries.\nUsing cloud-scale AI, our Security Cloud enriches and correlates trillions of cybersecurity events per week with indicators of attack, threat intelligence, and enterprise data (including data from across endpoints, workloads, identities, DevOps, IT assets, and configurations) to create actionable data, identify shifts in adversary tactics, and automatically prevent threats in real-time across our customer base.\nCrowdStrike: The Architectural Purpose Behind the Platform Our Falcon platform was purpose-built in the cloud to harness the power of data and AI to deliver the next generation of automated protection and provide threat hunters with the intelligence required to stop sophisticated attacks, including malware-free and fileless attacks.\nToday, we offer 29 cloud modules on our Falcon platform via a SaaS subscription-based model that spans multiple large markets, including corporate endpoint and cloud workload security, managed security services, security and vulnerability management, IT operations management, identity protection, next-generation security information and event management (\u201cSIEM\u201d) and log management, threat intelligence services, data protection, SaaS security posture management, Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (\u201cSOAR\u201d) and AI powered workflow automation, and securing generative AI workloads.\nThis also enables our Falcon platform to intelligently ingest data once and stream high fidelity data back into the Security Cloud to be re-used for multiple use cases, continuously improve our Falcon platform\u2019s AI algorithms and make its real-time decision-making faster and smarter to keep customers ahead of changing adversary tactics.\nThe highly advanced graph technologies underpinning the Falcon platform include: \u2022 Our Threat Graph, which uses a combination of AI and behavioral pattern-matching techniques to correlate and analyze trillions of cybersecurity events, enriched with threat intelligence, and third-party data to identify and link threat activity together to automatically prevent threats in real time across CrowdStrike\u2019s global customer base.\nThe Falcon platform was purpose-built with the foresight that the future of cybersecurity would need to be cloud-native and AI-driven.\nWhile AI is revolutionizing many technology fields, including cybersecurity solutions, to be truly effective, algorithms that enable AI depend on the quality and volume of data that trains them and the selection of the right differentiating features from that data.\nWe call this cloud-scale AI.\nOur technology is uniquely effective because we not only have a massive amount of high fidelity data to continuously train our AI models but also because we couple that data with deep human cybersecurity expertise, which supports our industry-leading efficacy and low false positives.\nBy analyzing and correlating information across our massive, crowdsourced dataset, we are able to deploy our AI algorithms at cloud-scale and build a more intelligent, effective solution to detect threats and stop breaches that on-premise, cloud-hosted and hybrid products cannot match due to the inherent architectural limitations those products have with respect to data storage and analysis.\nIn addition, the

concepts to providing advanced technical training aimed at equipping our engineers with the knowledge to develop cutting-edge GenAI products.\nTo remain competitive, we must adapt and migrate to new technologies, applications and processes, including the evolving use of AI technology.\nThe implementation of new technologies and infrastructure, such as migration to new cloud-based systems and increased utilization of AI internally and in our products and services, is complex and can involve substantial expenditures as well as risks inherent in the conversion to any new system, including potential loss of information and disruption to operations.\nIf we fail to keep pace with rapidly evolving AI technological developments, our competitive position and business results may be negatively impacted.\nOur use of AI technologies requires resources to develop, test and maintain such products, which is costly.\nDespite our investments in, and commitment of resources to, the development of AI products and technologies, we may not be successful in generating revenues from these efforts.\nIn addition, third parties may be able to use AI to create technology that could reduce demand for our products and services.\nThe introduction of AI technologies, particularly generative AI, into new or existing offerings may result in new or expanded risks and liabilities, due to enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, compliance issues, ethical concerns, confidentiality, data privacy or security risks, as well as other factors that could adversely affect our business, reputation, and financial results.\nIf the content, analyses, or recommendations that AI applications assist in producing are, or are alleged to be, deficient, inaccurate, unreliable, misleading, biased, discriminatory or otherwise flawed, any of which may not be easily detectable, our business and reputation may be adversely affected.\nUse of AI technologies, and the evolving legal, regulatory and compliance framework for AI, could impact our ability to protect our data and intellectual property, as well as vendor and client information, and could expose us to intellectual property or other claims by third parties.\nUse of AI technologies may also increase risks related to cyberattacks or other security incidents or result in a failure to protect confidential information.\nBecause AI technology is highly complex and rapidly developing, it is not possible to predict all of the legal, operational or technological risks that may arise relating to our use of AI.\nFailure to develop and market new products and enhancements that maintain our technological and competitive position and failure to anticipate and respond to changes in the marketplace for our products and customer demands The market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change, including developing technologies such as AI, methods and speed of delivery, changes in client demands, development of new investment instruments and evolving industry standards.\nWe must make long-term investments and commit significant resources, for example, to developing and utilizing AI technology, before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products and services that satisfy our clients' needs and generate 16 Table of Contents revenues required to provide the

(\u201cAI\u201d), involve risks that may adversely affect our operations.\nFor example, California enacted Assembly Bill 3030, known as the Artificial Intelligence in Health Care Services Bill (\u201cAB 3030\u201d), which requires that any health care facility using generative AI to create patient communications pertaining to patient clinical information ensure that the communications include (i) a disclaimer that the communication was generated by generative AI and (ii) clear instructions describing how a patient may contact a human health care provider or other appropriate person at the health care facility.\nFurther, Utah enacted the Artificial Intelligence Policy Act (\u201cAIPA\u201d), which requires physicians, nurses and other regulated health care providers to disclose to individuals if they are interacting with generative AI while receiving regulated services.\nAdditionally, Colorado has passed the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act (\u201cCAIA\u201d), which will impose significant disclosure, documentation, and risk management requirements on developers of and companies that deploy \u201chigh-risk\u201d AI systems, including systems used to recommend certain health care decisions.\nKeyword: ai\nFor example, we deploy third-party software programs, and in some instances develop our own software programs, utilizing machine learning/AI, including for use within our network to improve care.\nThe legal framework for AI (particularly in patient care) is rapidly developing and uncertain.\nIn 2023, HHS finalized transparency requirements for AI and other predictive algorithms used in certified health information technology, such as decision support interventions.\nSome states have adopted or are considering additional measures regarding the use of AI within the health care industry.\nIf we or our third-party providers are restricted from using AI as a result of any laws or regulations, it could impact our operations and cause us to incur costs to replace or modify our use of AI.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us or our third-party providers to comply with AI laws and regulations could result in legal proceedings or investigations, which could result in significant legal costs and potential liability, as well as reputational harm.\nFurther, we expect additional AI-related laws and regulations to come into effect, which could affect our business and financial condition.\nIncreasing use of AI technologies in our internal systems may create new attack surfaces or methods for threat actors, and threat actors may use AI technologies to make cyberattacks more difficult to detect, contain or mitigate.\nHealth care technology initiatives, particularly those related to sharing patient data and interoperability and AI, involve risks that may adversely affect our operations.\nIn particular, AI is driving innovation and, in some cases, augmenting risks related to health care technology.\nFor example, our physicians are adopting the use of generative AI to assist with the taking of patient medical notes, among other tasks.\nRapid changes in technology driven by AI may require us to expend significant resources to acquire, develop, implement and maintain that technology.\nThere is also a risk that our confidential information becomes part of a model that is accessible by other third-party AI applications or users as a result of a cybersecurity incident or a third-party AI developer\u2019s violation of our vendor engagement terms.\nThe development of AI technologies is complex, and there are technical challenges associated with achieving the desired level of accuracy, efficiency and reliability.\nFor instance, AI models used by us or third-party vendors may be based on biased or deficient datasets, which could result in inaccurate or misleading outputs.\nIneffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by us or third-party developers or vendors, including any disruptions or failures of AI systems once implemented, could result in unintended consequences.\nShould the use of AI technologies fail to operate as anticipated or not perform as specified, including any biases or errors in

responsible use of data.\n\u2022 Incorporating artificial intelligence technologies into our products, services, and operations may result in legal and regulatory risks or have other adverse consequences to our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nTechniques used to compromise or sabotage systems, including the use of advanced technologies, such as machine learning or generative artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d), change frequently, may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world, may be difficult to detect, and generally are not recognized until after they are launched against a target.\nOUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO COMPLEX AND EVOLVING LAWS AND REGULATIONS REGARDING DATA PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, AND RESPONSIBLE USE OF DATA.\nIn particular, the AI Act, European Health Data Space, and Data Act and Data Governance Acts regulate personal and non-personal data as well as artificial intelligence.\nINCORPORATING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGIES INTO OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND OPERATIONS MAY RESULT IN LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS OR HAVE OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES TO OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nFor example, on May 21, 2024, the European Union legislators approved the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (\u201cEU AI Act\u201d), which establishes a comprehensive, risk-based governance framework for AI in the EU market.\nKeyword: ai\nIn addition, with the prolific use of AI technologies, there is an increased risk of unauthorized or accidental disclosure.\nFor example, our employees, third-party service providers, strategic partners, or other contractors or consultants may input inappropriate or confidential information into an AI system (in particular, a system that is managed, owned, or controlled by a third party), thereby compromising our business operations.\nMoreover, some of the AI features of our products involve, or may involve, the processing of personal data and may be subject to laws, policies, legal obligations, and codes of conduct related to privacy and data protection, each of which may be interpreted in ways that may affect the way in which we engage with machine learning and require us to make changes to our business practices and products to comply with such obligations.\nOur use of AI technologies may involve the storage and transmission of confidential or sensitive information, including personal information of employees, customers, and others, as well as protected health information of clients\u2019 patients.\nOur current operations, products, and services use AI technologies, including machine learning.\nFuture innovations in our products and services will likely continue to incorporate AI, and these applications may become important in our operations over time, for example, our development of machine learning-enabled medical devices (\u201cMLMDs\u201d).\nIn addition, several aspects of intellectual property protection in the field of AI are currently under development, and there is uncertainty and ongoing litigation in different jurisdictions as to the degree and extent of protection warranted for AI technologies and relevant system input and outputs.\nIf we fail to obtain protection for the intellectual property rights concerning our AI technologies, or later have our intellectual property rights invalidated or otherwise diminished, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts to develop competing products, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe regulatory landscape surrounding AI is also evolving, and the use of machine learning technologies may expose us to an increased risk of regulatory enforcement and litigation.\nAs the FDA and other regulatory authorities continue to develop and incorporate such principles into their regulation of machine learning medical devices, it is possible that medical products using AI and machine learning will become subject to significant additional oversight, including with respect to premarket review, modification, monitoring, maintenance, and device performance.\nIn the U.S., an executive order was issued in October 2023 on the Safe, Secure and Trustworthy Development and Use of AI, emphasizing the need for transparency, accountability, and fairness in the development and use of AI, including in the healthcare industry.\nThe order seeks to balance fostering innovation with

training programs and educational resources to all employees covering a broad variety of topics such as leadership and management, artificial intelligence, data literacy and operational and professional skills.\nThe risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the future due to factors such as: \u2022 JPMorganChase\u2019s ongoing expansion of its digital banking and other internet-based product offerings and its internal use of internet-based products and applications, including those that use cloud computing services \u2022 advances in artificial intelligence, such as the use of machine learning, generative artificial intelligence and quantum computing by malicious actors to develop more advanced social engineering attacks, including targeted phishing attacks \u2022 the inability to maintain the security of information transmitted by JPMorganChase due to advances in quantum computing that may counteract or nullify existing information protections, and \u2022 the acquisition and integration of new businesses.\nThe increasing sophistication of artificial intelligence technologies poses a greater risk of identity fraud, as malicious actors may exploit artificial intelligence to create convincing false identities or manipulate verification processes.\nJPMorganChase relies on accurate, timely and complete data to effectively operate its

of data, the timeliness of data collection, the analysis or validation of data, or the safeguarding of data could undermine the reliability and effectiveness of its operations, including: \u2022 risk management practices, including inaccurate or untimely risk reporting \u2022 delivery of regulatory reporting or internal or external financial reporting \u2022 compliance practices, such as those relating to transaction monitoring, customer screening, blocking and rejecting transactions, recordkeeping or reporting \u2022 business activities, such as those related to managing JPMorganChase's

processing, lending services, account management and customer support, or \u2022 fraud detection and prevention processes.\nThe models and estimations that JPMorganChase uses, including those that use machine learning or artificial intelligence, may not be effective in all cases to identify, observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such as: \u2022 reliance on historical trends that may not persist in the future, including assumptions underlying the models and estimations such as correlations among certain market indicators or asset prices \u2022 inherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and financial outcomes \u2022 historical trend information may be incomplete, or may not be indicative of severely negative market conditions such as extreme

efficiently and to mitigate risk.\nKeyword: ai\nRegulation of AI is rapidly evolving in the U.S. and worldwide as legislators and regulators are increasingly focused on these powerful emerging technologies.\nThe technologies underlying AI and its uses are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including intellectual property, privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, consumer protection, competition, and equal opportunity laws, and are expected to be subject to increased regulation and new laws or new applications of existing laws and regulations.\nNorthern Trust has certain processes and controls in place designed to mitigate the risks associated with the use of AI solutions, including monitoring the development and applicability of such evolving laws and regulations, and will take steps designed to comply with laws and regulations applicable to Northern Trust\u2019s use of AI.\nData privacy and security risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the evolving proliferation of new technologies, the use of internet-based solutions, mobile devices, and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and rapidly evolving techniques of hackers, terrorists, organized crime and other external parties, including foreign state actors and state-sponsored actors, any of which may see their effectiveness enhanced by the use of AI.\nFurther, the regulatory framework for AI and similar technologies, and automated decision making, is changing rapidly.\nIt is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions, or that existing laws and regulations may be interpreted, in ways that would affect the operation of our products and services and the way in which we use AI and similar technologies.\nFor more information on regulations regarding AI, see \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d The evolving regulatory and supervisory environment and uncertainty about the timing and scope of future laws, regulations and policies may contribute to decisions we may make to suspend, reduce or withdraw from existing businesses, activities or initiatives, which may result in potential lost revenue or significant restructuring or related costs or exposures.\nAdditionally, technological advances (such as the use of generative AI) and the growth of internet-based commerce have made it possible for other types of institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business.\nOur success in the competitive environment in which we operate requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation, particularly in light of the current \u201cFinTech\u201d environment, in which the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes and financial institutions are investing significantly in evaluating new technologies, such as AI, machine learning, blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies, and developing potentially industry-changing new products, services and industry standards.\nWe use various systems and models, including AI-powered solutions, in analyzing and monitoring several risk categories, as well as for other business purposes.\nIn addition, the use of generative AI, a relatively new and emerging technology in the early stages of commercial use, exposes us to additional risks, such as damage to our reputation, competitive position, and business, legal and regulatory risks and additional costs.\nFor example, generative AI has been known to produce false or \u201challucinatory\u201d inferences or output, and certain generative AI uses machine learning and predictive analytics, which can create inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading content, unintended biases, and other discriminatory or unexpected results, errors or inadequacies, any of which may not be
