          "Cyber and information security risks for large financial institutions like us continue to increase due to the proliferation of new technologies, the industry-wide shift to reliance upon the internet to conduct financial transactions, the increased sophistication and activities of malicious actors, organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists, activists, extremist parties, formal and informal instrumentalities of foreign governments, state-sponsored or nation-state actors and other external parties and the growing use of AI by threat actors.",
          "The use of AI, \u201cbots\u201d or other automation software can increase the velocity and efficacy of these types of attacks.",
          "The methods and techniques employed by malicious actors continue to develop and evolve rapidly, including from emerging technologies, such as advanced forms of AI and quantum computing, are increasingly sophisticated and often are not fully recognized or understood until after they have occurred, and some techniques could occur and enable persistent access for an extended period of time before being detected and remediated, if at all.",
          "We face risks resulting from the extensive use of models and data, as well as from our evolving use of AI.",
          "We rely on quantitative models and in some cases the use of AI, as well as our ability to manage and aggregate data in an accurate and timely manner, to assess and manage our various risk exposures, create estimates and forecasts, and manage compliance with regulatory capital requirements.",
          "We continue to invest in building new capabilities that employ new AI technologies such as generative AI, and we expect our use of these technologies to increase over time.",
          "However, there are significant risks involved in utilizing models and AI and no assurance can be provided that our use will enhance our business or produce only intended or beneficial results.",
          "For example, generative AI has been known to produce false or \u201challucinatory\u201d inferences or output, and certain generative AI uses machine learning and predictive analytics, which can create inaccurate, incomplete or misleading output, unexpected results, errors or inadequacies, any of which may not be easily detectable.",

\u2022 Ford\u2019s vehicles could be affected by defects that result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, or delays in new model launches, and the time it takes to improve the quality of our vehicles and services and reduce the costs associated therewith could continue to have an adverse effect on our business; \u2022 Ford is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Ford\u2019s production schedule and specifications, and a shortage of or inability to timely acquire key components or raw materials can disrupt Ford\u2019s production of vehicles; \u2022 Ford\u2019s production, as well as Ford\u2019s suppliers\u2019 production, and/or the ability to deliver products to consumers could be disrupted by labor issues, public health issues, natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change, financial distress, production difficulties, capacity limitations, or other factors; \u2022 Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures, or business strategies or the benefits may take longer than expected to materialize; \u2022 Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of restructuring actions and such actions may cause Ford to incur significant charges, disrupt our operations, or harm our reputation; \u2022 Failure to develop and deploy secure digital services that appeal to customers and grow our subscription rates could have a negative impact on Ford\u2019s business; \u2022 Ford\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints; \u2022 Ford\u2019s ability to attract, develop, grow, support, and reward talent is critical to its success and competitiveness; \u2022 Operational information systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford, Ford Credit, their suppliers, and dealers; \u2022 To facilitate access to the raw materials and other components necessary for the production of electric vehicles, Ford has entered into and may, in the future, enter into multi-year commitments to raw material and other suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such items as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast; \u2022 With a global footprint and supply chain, Ford\u2019s results and operations could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events; \u2022 Ford\u2019s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and Ford\u2019s reputation may be harmed based on positions it takes or if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced; \u2022 Ford may face increased price competition for its products and services, including pricing pressure resulting from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or economic or other factors, particularly for electric vehicles; \u2022 Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and market value of Ford or Ford Credit\u2019s investments, including marketable securities, can have a significant effect on results; \u2022 Ford\u2019s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States; \u2022 Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, public health emergency, or significant geopolitical event; \u2022 The impact of government incentives on Ford\u2019s business could be significant, and Ford\u2019s receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback; \u2022 Ford and Ford Credit\u2019s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, asset portfolios, or other factors;

          "While new AI initiatives, laws, and regulations are emerging and evolving, what they ultimately will look like remains uncertain, and our obligation to comply with them could entail significant costs, negatively affect our business, or entirely limit our ability to incorporate certain AI capabilities into our offerings.",
          "The resulting impact of such regulations on our customers\u2019 desire for AI capabilities and demand for our offerings more generally could negatively impact our results of operations.",

          "Further, dependence on AI without adequate safeguards to make certain business decisions may introduce additional operational vulnerabilities by impacting our relationships with customers, partners, and suppliers; by producing inaccurate outcomes based on flaws in the underlying data; or other unintended results.",

          "Our use of AI technologies, whether created by us for internal or customer use cases or otherwise incorporated from external sources into our offerings, could lead to violation of third-party intellectual property rights, and could require us to incur significant expenses to modify our solutions and processes or otherwise engage in efforts to remain in compliance with the law.",
          "Additionally, the varying sizes of customer contracts or orders, variations in customer acceptances of delivered orders, the timing thereof, and cancellations and/or de-bookings of such orders (due to various reasons, including but not limited to failure to satisfy terms and compliance matters, whether initiated by us or the customer) can be uneven across our portfolio and have at times impacted, and in the future could impact, our pipeline, bookings and our ability to recognize revenue, if at all (particularly with respect to contracts and orders involving our AI offerings).",
          "In addition, our business is subject to an ever-growing number of laws and regulations addressing privacy and information security, including the use of AI.",
          "Furthermore, the rapid development and deployment of tools that leverage AI is also causing governments to consider and implement regulation of AI, even for AI that does not pertain to personal data, which is impacting and may further impact the use and incorporation of AI capabilities in our offerings and in our customer\u2019s demand for such offerings.",
          "We have received inquiries, and may be subject to demands, claims, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, and additional inquiries (including those from U.S. or foreign governmental authorities), relating to AI use cybersecurity and data incidents that we have experienced or may in the future experience.",

          "\u201cRisk Factors\u201d and throughout this Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K. \u2022 Our operating results are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets, as well as fluctuating global and United States economic conditions, political dissension, inflation, higher interest rates, uncertainty in financial markets, and geopolitical tensions; \u2022 Supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, or labor inflation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or operating results; \u2022 A significant portion of our costs and expenses are fixed, including increasing property taxes, insurance costs, and HOA fees, and we may not be able to adapt our costs structure to offset declines in our revenue; \u2022 Timing and costs of renovating our properties and the cost of maintaining rental properties may negatively affect our financial results ; \u2022 Concentration of our investments in certain markets and in the single-family properties sector of the real estate industry exposes us to seasonal fluctuations in rental demand and downturns in our markets or in the single-family properties sector; \u2022 We face significant competition for quality residents, which may limit our ability to lease homes on favorable terms; \u2022 Our reliance on information supplied by prospective residents, which may be inaccurate, may lead to poor leasing decisions, and our portfolio may contain more risk than we believe; 3 \u2022 If a significant number of our residents fail to meet their lease obligations or fail to renew their leases, our reputation, financial performance, and ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected; \u2022 We face risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions of properties which could lead to material losses on our investments in our properties and adversely impact anticipated yields, including risks related to: \u2022 competition in identifying and acquiring our properties; \u2022 possible title defects; \u2022 acquisitions of new homes from third-party homebuilders; \u2022 bulk portfolio acquisitions and dispositions; \u2022 acquisitions through an auction process; \u2022 evaluation of properties based on potentially inaccurate assumptions; \u2022 difficulty selling our real estate investments; and \u2022 acquisitions of properties consistent with our investment strategy regardless of favorability of rental and housing markets; \u2022 Our dependence upon third parties for key services may have an adverse effect on our operating results or reputation if the third parties fail to perform; \u2022 Relatively short lease terms expose us to the risk that we may have to re-lease our properties frequently, which we may be unable to do on attractive terms, on a timely basis, or at all; \u2022 Fluctuations of rent rates in our markets could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and ability to make distributions to our stockholders; \u2022 Declining real estate valuations and impairment charges could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results; \u2022 Investments in joint ventures may restrict our market choices and expose us to challenges, including limited decision-making authority, reliance on partners' financial conditions, potential liabilities for services provided, and disputes with joint venture partners; \u2022 We may suffer losses that are not covered by insurance and we may elect to self-insure against potential losses; \u2022 We may encounter challenges providing property and asset management services to portfolio owners of single-family homes leading to management distractions or operational inconsistencies; \u2022 Compliance with evolving and sometimes inconsistent federal, state, and local laws and regulatory requirements, including expanding tenant rights\u2019 laws, restrictions on evictions and collections, rent control laws, affordability covenants, permit, license, and zoning requirements, may negatively impact our rental income and profitability; \u2022 Legal and regulatory proceedings and demands from tenant and consumer advocacy organizations, exacerbated by increased political and regulatory scrutiny of our industry, and negative publicity could constrain our operations and may result in significant litigation expenses and reputational harm; \u2022 Many of our properties are part of HOAs, subjecting us and our residents to the rules of such HOAs, which are subject to change, and violations may lead to additional fees and penalties and costly litigation with such HOAs; \u2022 Leasing fraud may negatively impact our operations, including the loss of revenue and/or an increase in costs to combat these activities, and may result in fines, settlements, litigation expenses, and reputational damage; \u2022 We are highly dependent on information systems, and system failures, security breaches, and our use of emerging technologies such as AI could disrupt our business and present business, reputational, legal, and compliance risks; \u2022 We are subject to risks related to sustainability, corporate responsibility, and governance issues, including risks from natural disasters, environmentally hazardous conditions, and physical and transitional climate change risks; 4 \u2022 Difficulty securing financing from debt and equity markets, or a credit ratings downgrade may negatively impact our growth strategy, financial condition, and operating results; \u2022 We utilize a significant amount of indebtedness in our business, and our cash flows and operating results could be adversely affected by required debt payments or related interest and other risks of our debt financing; \u2022 Provisions of Maryland law and our charter may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if such change in control would be in the best interests of our stockholders; and \u2022 Failure to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d) may result in taxation as a regular domestic corporation leading to a substantial tax liability, and maintaining our REIT status may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits.",

          "SUMMARY RISK FACTORS Some of the factors that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, include the following: \u2022 Our results of operations and investments could be adversely affected by geopolitical or macroeconomic conditions; \u2022 We are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from errors and omissions, breach of fiduciary duty and other claims; \u2022 We cannot guarantee that we are or will be in compliance with all current and potentially applicable U.S. federal and state or foreign laws and regulations, and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business; \u2022 O ur business or reputation could be harmed by our reliance on third-party providers or introducers; \u2022 We may not be able to effectively identify and manage actual and apparent conflicts of interest; \u2022 We could incur significant liability or our reputation could be damaged if our information systems are breached or we otherwise fail to protect client or Company data or information systems; \u2022 The costs to comply with, or our failure to comply with, U.S. and foreign laws related to privacy, data security and data protection, such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, (CCPA), Australia's CPS 234, as well as emerging AI-related laws such as the EU's AI Act, could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and our reputation; \u2022 Our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to develop and implement improvements in technology or respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological change such as AI; \u2022 The loss of members of our senior management team or other key colleagues, or if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to attract, retain and develop talent, could have a material adverse effect on our business; \u2022 Failure to maintain our corporate culture could adversely affect our business and reputation; \u2022 Increasing scrutiny and changing laws and expectations from regulators, investors, clients and our colleagues with respect to our environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices and disclosure may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks; \u2022 We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses, including from disintermediation, as our competitive landscape continues to evolve; \u2022 We rely on a large number of vendors and other third parties to perform key functions of our business operations and to provide services to our clients.",
          "If we fail to comply or are accused of failing to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those referred to above, or new and evolving regulations regarding cybersecurity, AI or sustainability matters, we may become subject to investigations, criminal penalties, civil remedies or other consequences, including fines, injunctions, loss of an operating license or approval, increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities, the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in a particular business or redress to clients or other parties, and we may become exposed to negative publicity or reputational damage.",
          "We are at risk of attack by a variety of adversaries, including nation states, state-sponsored organizations, opportunistic attacks, and organized crime and hackers, through use of increasingly sophisticated methods of attack, including the deployment of AI to find and exploit vulnerabilities, \"deep fakes\", long-term, persistent attacks (referred to as advanced persistent threats) and the use of the IT supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised suppliers accounts or hardware.",
          "In particular, the advance of AI and large language models has given rise to additional vulnerabilities and potential entry points for cyber threats.",
          "With generative AI tools, threat actors may have additional tools to automate breaches or persistent attacks, evade detection, or generate sophisticated phishing emails or other forms of digital impersonation, doing so quickly and without requiring deep technical understanding of potential exploits.",
          "In addition, increasing use of generative AI models in our internal systems may create new attack methods for adversaries.",
          "Because generative AI is a new field, understanding of cybersecurity risks and protection methods continues to develop, and features that rely on generative AI, including in services provided to us by third parties, may be susceptible to unanticipated cybersecurity threats from sophisticated adversaries and other cybersecurity incidents.",
          "The costs to comply with, or our failure to comply with, U.S. and foreign laws related to privacy, data security and data protection, such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, (CCPA), Australia's CPS 234, as well as emerging AI-related laws such as the EU's AI Act, could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and our reputation.",
          "Additionally, certain foreign, U.S. federal and U.S. state governments are increasingly enacting, or are considering enacting, AI-related laws and regulations, such as the EU's AI Act, the AI Transparency Act of California and the AI Act of Colorado, which impose complex new obligations on developers and providers of AI systems.",
          "Given the emerging nature of AI technology, the lack of legal or regulatory precedent, and the ambiguity surrounding key definitions, complying with these evolving legal and regulatory frameworks is likely to be both challenging and costly.",
          "Furthermore, as new and divergent AI laws and regulations continue to emerge globally, they could significantly increase our risk of liability and fines, impact our ability to deploy and utilize AI tools across different jurisdictions, disrupt operations and prospective business and increase our compliance burdens.",
          "Privacy or AI-related legal or regulatory violations, including unauthorized use disclosure or transfer of sensitive, personal or confidential client or Company data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, by the Company, our vendors or other parties with whom we do business (if they fail to meet the standards we impose) could damage our reputation and subject us to significant litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions where we operate.",
          "Given the complexity of operationalizing the various privacy, data security, data protection and AI laws and regulations mentioned above, the complexity of proposed compliance frameworks and the continued lack of certainty on how to implement their requirements, we and our clients are at risk of enforcement actions taken by applicable regulators or authorities around the world or litigation from third parties, including consumer advocacy groups acting on behalf of data subjects.",
          "Our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to develop and implement improvements in technology or respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological change such as AI.",
          "We have a number of strategic initiatives involving investments in or 21 partnerships with technology companies as part of our growth strategy, as well as investments in technology, including generative AI, and infrastructure to support our own systems.",
          "In addition, to remain competitive in many of our business areas, we must anticipate and respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological change such as generative AI.",
          "These players are focused on using technology and innovation, including AI, digital platforms, data analytics, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve the client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the industries in which we operate.",
          "We are actively investing in generative AI tools.",
          "While our internal generative AI tool, LenAI, was designed to meet our standards for data security and to address and mitigate the risks associated with this new technology, our use of generative AI in certain products, services and operations may present risks and challenges that remain uncertain due to the relative novelty of this technology.",
          "The models underlying AI tools may be incorrectly or inadequately designed or implemented and trained on, or otherwise use, data or algorithms that are (and the output generated by such AI tools also may be) biased, unethical, discriminatory, incomplete, inaccurate, misleading or poor-quality, any of which may not be easily detectable.",
          "To the extent that we do not have sufficient rights to use the data used in or output generated by such AI tools, we may be subject to litigation by holders of third-party intellectual property, privacy, publicity, contractual or other rights.",
          "If any of our employees, contractors, consultants, vendors or service providers use any third-party AI powered software in connection with our business or the services they provide to us, it may lead to the inadvertent disclosure or incorporation of our confidential information into publicly available training sets, which may impact our ability to realize the benefit of, or adequately maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property or confidential information, harming our competitive position and business.",
          "In addition, the use of AI by other companies has resulted in, and our use of AI may in the future result in, data incidents and cybersecurity breaches.",
          "While we have implemented certain mitigation measures and governance related to the proliferation of AI tools, these measures may be inadequate or may not satisfy a growing number of legal and regulatory requirements related to AI.",
          "Moreover, if we are perceived to exaggerate the effectiveness, safety or ethical design of AI systems, this could lead to regulatory enforcement, litigation or reputational harm.",
          "Any misrepresentation, intentional or unintentional, of our AI-related capabilities or initiatives could also erode trust among clients and regulators.",
          "There can be no assurance that our use of AI will enhance our products, services or operations or otherwise result in our intended outcomes.",
          "Mercer\u2019s Investments business is subject to a number of risks, including risks related to litigation (both by clients and by plan participants, particularly when we act in a fiduciary capacity), liquidity and market volatility, an inability to obtain contractual limitations of liability for errors & omissions in certain jurisdictions or parts of our business, third-parties, our operations and technology (including the use of AI), trading and execution errors, conflicts of interest, asset performance and regulatory compliance and scrutiny, which could arise in connection with these offerings."
